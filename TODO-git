Figure out nsabot address from weasel.  Should the post-commit-diff
script cc it, or will the bot subscribe to or-cvs?

get from arma:
        - Arma needs to start git-daemon with --user-path
        - ideas for group-granularity.  We do not need to give people push
          rights!  Only the leads for each project.
	- groups for each project.
        - http/https git support: later
	- see if have @commit.noreply.org is already on or-cvs.
